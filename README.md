# Data analysis projects

## Outlined
This project involves a complex data analysis script written in Python. It is designed to manipulate and analyse the datasets contained in CSV files, with a particular focus on a file called `NCHS.csv`.

## Features
- **Data Loading:** The script first loads the dataset from the CSV file using Pandas, a powerful data manipulation library in Python.
- **Data Simplification:** It then simplifies the dataset by removing specific columns (e.g. detailed cause of death) to focus on more routine data.
- **Data Aggregation:** The script aggregates the data to provide a summary view. This includes summing the total number of deaths for each cause and calculating the average age-adjusted death rate.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** The script is written in Python and is known for its simplicity and powerful data manipulation features.
- **Pandas Library:** Used for data loading, manipulation, and aggregation, Pandas is the cornerstone of the Python data analysis ecosystem.

## How to Use
1. Make sure Python is installed on your system.
2. Install Pandas with `pip install pandas`.
3. Place the file in the appropriate directory with `NCHS.csv`.
4. Run the script with `python programming.py`.
